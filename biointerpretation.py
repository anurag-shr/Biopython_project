# Step 6: Biological Interpretation
"""""
The selected sequence represents ORF24 from Fowl aviadenovirus C.
Based on BLASTp analysis, this protein shows similarity to ORF proteins
found in other related aviadenoviruses, suggesting that it is conserved
across viral species.

The conservation of ORF24 indicates that it is likely to have an
important role in the viral life cycle. Proteins that are preserved
across related viruses are usually involved in essential viral
processes.


Although the exact function of ORF24 has not been experimentally
confirmed, the observed sequence similarity suggests that it may be
involved in viral replication, structural organization, or interactions
between the virus and its host.

Overall, this functional prediction is based on homology and sequence
conservation and represents a computational inference rather than
experimental validation.
